# Online-Machine-Learning-Weather-and-Metro-Interactions
Compiled for a university sponsored hackathon, our group utilized online machine learning tactics, as opposed to batch machine learning, to understand if forecasted weather in a given day effects bus service incidents in the Washington DC metro area

# Requirements to excecute scripts
Visit the [rotationalio data playground GitHub](https://github.com/rotationalio/data-playground) page and follow the README.md files in the [data-playground/wmata/python](https://github.com/rotationalio/data-playground/blob/main/wmata/python/README.md) folder as well as the [data-playground/weather/](https://github.com/rotationalio/data-playground/blob/main/weather/python/README.md) python files. Detailed instructions on how to set up a personal Ensign account and retrieving WMATA and NOAA APIS will be provided.

# Set up for executing the ML model
In order to train the Weather Metro Interaction ML model three other scripts must be run simultaneousally so live data can be streamed in from the NOAA API, the WMAT API, and then merged togher to be pushed to a final topic which will be utlizied in the Weather Metro Interaction ML model. 

*Order of excecution matters* the Weather_Publisher and the Metro_Publisher scripts must be run prior to the Weather_Metro_Merged script

**1**. Weather_Publisher

**2**. Metro_Publisher

**3**. Weather_Metro_Merged

**4**. Online ML Model
